# MoviesLibrary
Movies Library is a dynamic web application where users can register, search for movies, rate them and create personalised rankings. 
This application uses IMBD API to request movie information and SQL database to store user data. 
The back end of the project was handled by Python and Flask framework. 
The database was built and managed using SQLite3 and the front end was completed using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
